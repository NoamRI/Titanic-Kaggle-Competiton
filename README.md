Titanic Kaggle Competition

Hi!

Have you ever heared the tragic story of the Titanic? I assume you have...
but if not- 

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg.
Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this classification ML project, I built a ML model that answers the question:
“what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
In other words, the classification model predict if a passenger on the Titanic will survive or not.

My work on this project includes- feature engineering, data analysis, pre-processing, feature selection, model selection
and eventually the final model that predict the survival status on unseen passengers data.

I used the Python libraries- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

This is my first time I participate in a kaggle competiton.
I am proud of what I did in this project and proud about all the new stuff that I learned during my work,
and I am glad to say that as of my submission date, my predicted results are in the top 5% !!
